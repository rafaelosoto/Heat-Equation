  What is it?
  ——————————-

Solutions to the partial differential equation that models heat
flow through a system. Numerical and analytical techniques are used
for the solution, and various plotting techniques are used in order to better visualize the system’s transformation through space and time. This was a project for my computational physics course. More in-depth information is provided in the .pdf.

  Various Figures
  ———————————————
There are seven different solutions/figures representing different systems. This is a brief overview of what system they correspond to:

	1. Numerical time-stepping solution for the heat equation.
	2. Analytical solution for the heat equation.
	3. Heat equation for a 1-D bar with a heat map showing temp.
	4. Display of the instability that occurs when a certain constant
		is greater than .5
	5. Heat equation solution with parameters of an Iron bar.
	6. Solution approximation based on sines.
	7. Two metal bars in contact with different starting temperatures.
